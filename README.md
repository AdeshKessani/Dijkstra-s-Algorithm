# DijkstraGraph

DijkstraGraph is a C++ project implementing graph data structures and Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm. It includes core graph classes, a priority queue, and a demonstration of efficient pathfinding.

## Features
- Graph representation with nodes and edges
- Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm
- Custom heap priority queue
- Example program to demonstrate functionality

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++11 or later compiler
- Standard C++ development environment

### Building
Compile source files using your favorite toolchain:

### Running
Run the compiled executable:

## Project Structure
- `Graph.hpp` / `Graph.cpp`: Graph data structure implementation
- `HeapQueue.hpp`: Priority queue used by Dijkstra’s algorithm
- `main.cpp`: Example usage demonstrating shortest path calculation
